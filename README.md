# Email Switch

It aggregates many Email Providers.

## Docker image

Use images with tag `latest` for production. 
Images that are tagged with `main` can be broken, they are used for development.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/roman-koshchei/email-switch:latest
```

## Single exe

I added GitHub Action to build API as single executable for major platforms on releases.
Go to [latest release](https://github.com/roman-koshchei/email-switch/releases/latest) to find build for your OS.
